# Frameless Window Wrapper for Chrome

This is the source code for my Chrome application which can be viewed on the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/frameless-window-wrapper/afammnlhelfghkcaaollfdnglinlgafl).

##### I am focused on more important projects thus I will not be providing updates to this application. If you want any features (like no titlebar) please submit a pull request of your update/randition and it may get added into the next release.
